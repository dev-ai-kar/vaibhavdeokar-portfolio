<p class="lead">
This is where the main point of the post usually goes, right after the title and optional image. It sets the stage, often using a distinct style like this 'lead' paragraph to draw the reader in. It aims to summarize or entice, providing a brief overview before diving into the details that follow. </p>

<p>
Following the introduction, standard posts often break down information into digestible paragraphs. This helps maintain readability and allows for the natural flow of ideas. Each paragraph might tackle a specific point or build upon the previous one, guiding the reader through the narrative or explanation methodically.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sample-1050.jpg"
            srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sample-2100.jpg 2100w,
                    {{ site.baseurl }}/images/sample-1050.jpg 1050w,
                    {{ site.baseurl }}/images/sample-525.jpg 525w" sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" alt="">
</p>

<p>
Images are frequently used to break up text, illustrate points, or simply add visual interest. A standard format often includes images placed strategically between paragraphs, sometimes with captions, ensuring they complement the surrounding content without disrupting the flow too much. Responsive images are key for different screen sizes.
</p>

<h2>Large Heading</h2>

<p>
Headings play a crucial role in organizing content. Larger headings like H2 often signify major sections within the post. They break the text into logical parts, making it easier for readers to scan and understand the structure of the information being presented. Links, like <a href="http://#">this example</a>, can be embedded naturally within the text.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in
    him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into
    the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be
    saved through him.
    </p>
    <cite>John 3:16-17 ESV</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
Blockquotes are useful for highlighting text from other sources or emphasizing a particular point. They stand out visually from the regular paragraphs. After a blockquote, the text typically resumes the main narrative or discussion, perhaps commenting on or expanding upon the quoted material.
</p>

<h3>Smaller Heading</h3>

<p>
Smaller headings, like H3, denote subsections within a larger topic introduced by an H2. They provide further granularity, breaking down complex ideas into smaller, more manageable chunks for the reader. This hierarchical structure is fundamental to well-organized content.
</p>

<p>
Often, multiple paragraphs will fall under a single heading, each contributing to the sub-topic. Consistency in tone and style helps maintain coherence throughout these sections, ensuring the reader stays engaged and follows the logical progression of the content.
</p>

```css
code {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    margin: 0 .2rem;
    padding: .2rem .6rem;
    white-space: nowrap;
    background: #F1F1F1;
    border: 1px solid #E1E1E1;	
    border-radius: 3px;
}
```

<p>
Code snippets are essential in technical posts or tutorials. They are typically presented in preformatted blocks, often with syntax highlighting, to clearly display code examples separate from the explanatory text. This paragraph follows such a block.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Donec nulla non metus auctor fringilla.
        <ul>
            <li>Sub-item One</li>
            <li>Sub-item Two</li>
            <li>Sub-item Three</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Donec nulla non metus auctor fringilla.</li>
    <li>Donec nulla non metus auctor fringilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And finally, posts often conclude with a summary, a call to action, or a final thought. Lists, like the one above, are another way to structure information clearly, whether ordered or unordered. This standard format provides a familiar and effective way to communicate online.
