After years of building GenAI solutions in the bustling tech corridors of Mumbai, I’ve arrived in Syracuse with a singular mission: to explore the frontiers of emotionally resonant AI and collaborative robotics. This isn’t just a career pivot—it’s a philosophical commitment to designing systems that understand, adapt, and empathize.

### 🌍 Why I Chose This Path

My journey began with curiosity and code, but it deepened through reflection. Working on GenAI deployments for global clients taught me the power of scale—but also the limits of purely algorithmic intelligence. I realized that the next leap in AI won’t be about faster models—it’ll be about more human ones.

Human-Centered AI, to me, is the art of embedding emotional intelligence, ethical reasoning, and cultural context into our machines. Collaborative robotics is its natural extension: systems that don’t just automate tasks, but co-create experiences with us.

### 🧠 Where I Stand Now

I’ve officially launched my M.S. in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Syracuse University, with a focus on:

- GenAI, NLP, and ethical AI architectures
- Data Structures & Algorithms and DBMS for robust cognitive scaffolding
- Designing Eve v1: a modular AI assistant with memory buffers, emotional zoning, and bias filtration

My workspace is now modular—symbolic zones for focus, reflection, and recharge. My routines are calibrated for deep learning and emotional clarity. And my resume is tuned for research internships at the intersection of robotics, cognition, and empathy.

### ✍️ First Steps

- Initiated a weekly reflection series to document learnings, challenges, and breakthroughs
- Began sketching Eve v1’s emotional logic inspired by Buddhist rituals and symbolic design
- Joined student networks and research clubs to integrate culture and collaboration into my academic rhythm

### 🔭 The Vision Ahead

In five years, I aim to architect AI companions that don’t just respond—but resonate. Systems that understand context, adapt to emotion, and co-evolve with their users. I want to contribute frameworks that bridge technical rigor with human nuance—embraced by both research labs and real-world communities.

This journey is not just about building tech. It’s about building trust, meaning, and shared intelligence.

🌀 Whether you're a fellow technologist, a curious mind, or someone exploring the soul of machines—thank you for being part of this journey. I’ll be sharing weekly reflections, project updates, and design insights right here.

Let’s build something that feels. Let’s build something that matters.
