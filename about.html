                        Growing up in India, technology seemed like pure magic. I vividly remember the day my father brought home a computer; I was instantly captivated, spending hours exploring its inner workings, driven by an insatiable curiosity about *how* it all came together. This early fascination, witnessing the dawn of AI through my father's work, sparked a lifelong passion. While formal engineering at Ramrao Adik Institute provided a foundation, it was this inherent drive to understand and build that truly guided my path, transforming childhood wonder into a dedicated pursuit of innovation.

                        The traditional classroom sometimes felt restrictive. My grades weren't always stellar, a typical "average engineer" story perhaps. But outside the syllabus, a universe opened up. I stumbled upon Coursera, a digital haven. Suddenly, I wasn't just learning engineering; I was learning *how to learn*. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck!) didn't just teach Python; he made programming feel like a conversation. Andrew Ng didn't just explain neural networks; he unveiled the art behind AI. These weren't just courses; they were sparks igniting a wildfire of exploration.

                        This self-driven learning transformed me. Python, Deep Learning, Full-Stack Development – each new skill wasn't just a tool, but a new lens to see the world. Projects like recognizing handwritten digits or deploying ML models weren't just assignments; they were adventures. My internship and subsequent roles at Cognizant weren't just jobs; they were real-world labs where theory met practice, especially working on GenAI and seeing AI make decisions autonomously. The journey wasn't about becoming the best student, but about becoming a relentless learner, a polymath in the making, driven not by grades, but by an insatiable desire to build, create, and understand.

                        This journey from a curious kid in Mumbai to an aspiring AI specialist hasn't been linear. It's been a blend of formal education, real-world challenges, late-night coding sessions fueled by online courses, and the constant drive to connect the dots. Now, aiming for a Master's in Applied Human-Centered AI at Syracuse feels like the natural next step – not just to deepen my technical expertise, but to learn how to build AI that truly understands and serves humanity. Inspired by researchers like Andrej Karpathy, my ambition extends towards contributing to the future of intelligent systems, perhaps even humanoid robotics, always guided by that initial spark of curiosity.
